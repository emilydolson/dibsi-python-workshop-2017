# Python Workshop at DIBSI, 2017 (at UC Davis)

Materials from the workshop are all available at this website.

The Jupyter notebook containing all of the code is [here](DIBSI_Python.ipynb). You can view it on the web (without opening it on your own computer) [here](https://github.com/emilydolson/dibsi-python-workshop-2017/blob/gh-pages/DIBSI_Python.ipynb).

The example data parsing script that we wrote is [here](process_dn_ds.py). You can view it [here](https://github.com/emilydolson/dibsi-python-workshop-2017/blob/gh-pages/process_dn_ds.py).

The Jupyter notebook that imports the functions from that script is [here](Importing_Script.ipynb). You can also view it [here](https://github.com/emilydolson/dibsi-python-workshop-2017/blob/gh-pages/Importing_Script.ipynb). Note: this file must be in the same folder as process_dn_ds.py to work.
