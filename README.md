# Python Workshop at DIBSI, 2017 (at UC Davis)

Links to all materials from the workshop.

The Jupyter notebook containing all of the code is [here](DIBSI_Python.ipynb). You can view it on the web (without opening it on your own computer) [here](https://github.com/emilydolson/dibsi-python-workshop-2017/blob/gh-pages/DIBSI_Python.ipynb).

The example data parsing script that we wrote is [here](process_dn_ds.py). You can view it [here](https://github.com/emilydolson/dibsi-python-workshop-2017/blob/gh-pages/process_dn_ds.py).

The Jupyter notebook that imports the functions from that script is [here](Importing_Script.ipynb). You can also view it [here](https://github.com/emilydolson/dibsi-python-workshop-2017/blob/gh-pages/Importing_Script.ipynb). Note: this file must be in the same folder as process_dn_ds.py to work.

The collaboratively edited course notes are [here](https://hackmd.io/s/HknRGNZHW).

Parts of this material were drawn from the Software Carpentry Python lessons: [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/). I also drew from [this](https://emilydolson.github.io/python-dataviz/) draft lesson on data visualization that I created for a different workshop.

My notes on Pandas and files are [here](https://hackmd.io/s/B1EgONXSW), but they're really not as good as the main HackMD pad.
