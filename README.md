# Python Workshop at DIBSI, 2017 (at UC Davis)

Materials from the workshop are all available at this website.

The Jupyter notebook containing all of the code is [here](DIBSI_Python.ipynb).
The example data parsing script that we wrote is [here](process_dn_ds.py).
The Jupyter notebook that imports the functions from that script is [here](Importing_Script.ipynb).
